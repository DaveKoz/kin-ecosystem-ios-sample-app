# kin-ecosystem-ios-sample-app

This app showcases the use of the [Kin Ecosystem iOS SDK](https://github.com/kinfoundation/kin-ecosystem-ios-sdk).

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `pod install`

## Usage
1. Obtain an app key and app id from the Kin Foundation.
2. Once running, enter your key and id in the fields on the app's start page.
3. Select `New User`

In later sessions you'd be able to choose between continuing with the last logged in user, or starting a new one.

### Disclaimer
> This is a very minimal app designed just to launch the Kin Marketplace and allow interacting with all of Kin SDK's appearance on hosting apps. It is maintained from time to time, but at a low priority.
</br>For more info on using the actual SDK in your own app, go to [Kin Ecosystem iOS SDK](https://github.com/kinfoundation/kin-ecosystem-ios-sdk).
